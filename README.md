# GameSaver

**Game Saver** is a program designed to back up important files at fixed intervals.
It will automatically start when a program of choice is launched and automatically close
when that same program is terminated.

I plan to have it fully customizable and automate creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

Game Saver is only compatible with Windows, as it uses Windows Task Scheduler to
automatically start and stop the program when it detects programs of interest
being stopped or started.

Game Saver is still a work in progress. Check back later for more updates.
